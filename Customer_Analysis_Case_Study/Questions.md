1. I tried to use here (customer life time value type correction) method chaining but I had problems because pd.str only works with series with all items = str. Is there a work around to this?
2. In column customer life time value, do we need to multiply by 100 the items with a %?
3. I have a helper function with 2 arguments (one always the same, a dictionary). How I pass to the map in the main function a function with two arguments?
4. How I define the helper function seems clunky (I need to define cleaning_dict before defining the function). Is there a better way?
How can I map a function to a 2D array? Here I used a nested map but I'm wondering is a "pythonic" way of doing this
Is my approach for the total response rate efficient, or too complicated
