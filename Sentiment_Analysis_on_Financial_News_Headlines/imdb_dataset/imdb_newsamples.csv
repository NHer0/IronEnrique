"""It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (LÃ©a Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.

I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no ""Diamonds are Forever."" And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn't they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.""",5
"""It felt as though we were never going to get to see this, but finally it's here, the question is, was it worth the wait?

The answer, yes, really not what I was expecting, of course it's action packed, dramatic and high octane, but it actually boasts a good story, and perhaps shows us a slightly different side to the character.

Plenty of action, plenty of style, and a real twist.

I thought Daniel Craig was awesome, and here he shows what a great Bond he has been, it's fascinating now to know who'll take over.

On the downside, it was a bit long, and it did lull a little in parts, but the action was enough to halt any dozing.""",8
"""Most unoriginal crime/comedy, done a billion times before, not necessarily better, but with less pretentiousness. You know who the three leads are and two of them are sort of unbearable, Reynolds wisecracking non-stop without being funny in the least and Gadot as the coolest, sexiest (and most pretentious and unlikely) thief in the world. The Rock is playing it straighter, as the alleged FBI profiler pursuing criminals around the world, but I wouldn't consider it award-worthy.

It is that type of movie where scenes take place all around the world, each geographical shift announced by large, red letters screaming LONDON, BALI, VALENCE or whatever, each location being only a pathetic excuse to drag the plot along a little more. Said plot should be about recovering three golden eggs that belonged to Cleopatra, but when I wrote that, I realized how stupid it sounds, because it is stupid. It could have been about recovering Plato's papyrus or Caesar's chessboard, anything just as absurd and stupid sounding...

The movie played on Netflix until the end only because hubby watched it, while I played a videogame and wondered if Reynolds was ever going to shut up.""",1
